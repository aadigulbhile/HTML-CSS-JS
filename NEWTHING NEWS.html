	Delhi News Today Live Updates, January 12: Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a section of the highly-anticipated Delhi-Mumbai expressway on Sunday. The 246-km Delhi-Dausa-Lalsot section will be thrown open to the public, reducing the travel time from the national capital to Jaipur from five hours to about three hours. During the programme, scheduled to begin at 3 pm in Dausa, Rajasthan, the Prime Minister will also lay the foundation stone for 247 km of National Highway projects to be developed at a cost of more than Rs 5,940 crore.

The Delhi-Dausa-Lalsot section of the Expressway, the first to be completed, has been developed at a cost of more than Rs 12,150 crore and is expected to provide a major boost to the economic development of the entire region.
